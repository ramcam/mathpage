<h3>Quintic polynomials are rarely solvable</h3>
<p>
    The insolvability of the quintic is a problem that has given me a fair 
    amount of headache. Its proof by means of Galois theory is highly abstract and
    is usually exposed by concatenating several seeminly unmotivated steps.
    Here I will try to take you 
    (with some effort on your side) 
    through a path in which I hope will feel that one step unfolds 
    naturally from the other.
    It will probably not be the fastest path,
    but will surely be more rewarding than trying to digest a polished
    exposition. 
 </p>

 <p>
    Be sure to check the list of requirements before embarking 
    on this journey. You should have basic knowledge of
    <ul>
        <li>Complex numbers</li>
        <li>Groups, subgroups and normal subgroups</li>
        <li>Rings and fields</li>
        <li>Polynomials over a field</li>
        <li>Field extensions</li>
        <li>Algebraic closures</li>
    </ul>
    
 </p>
 
 <p>
   Let's get started!
 </p>
 <p>
    Informally, what we set out to prove is that
 </p>
 <p class="informal-def">
    The zeros of quintic polynomials 
    cannot always be written with a radical expression.
 </p>

 <p>
    We are referring to quintic polynomials with coefficients in 
    $ \Q $ here. A radical expression means combining
    elements in $ \Q $ with the 
    usual operations of the field ($ + - \times \div$) and 
    $ \sqrt[n]{\phantom{a}} $, like this
    $$
    \frac{3\sqrt[7]{1-\sqrt[3]{-1}}}{11\sqrt[5]{8}}.
    $$
 </p>
 <p>
   We know from high school that this is possible, since for the 
   polynomial $ p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $ the zeros $ z_1, z_2 $ are given 
   by the quadratic formula
   $$
   z_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
   $$
 </p>
 <p>
   We also know (although we don't bother to write it here) that this
   is also possible for any polynomial of degree $3$ or $4$. We will 
   pretend that we don't know what happens for degrees $ n \geq 5 $ 
   but some intuition tells us that it is not possible.
 </p>

 <p>
   Our first task will be to restate the Insolvability
   of the Quintic in terms of some property of polynomials. Ideally, 
   this property shows up in polynomials of degree $ n \leq 4 $ 
   but is not present for higher degrees. 
   What could this property be?
 </p>

 <p>
    
    You will recall that a field is closed under the operations
    $ + - \times \div$ (except division by zero). However,
    $n$-th roots might take us <em>outside</em> of $ \Q $.
   Take for example the polynomials
   $$ 
   \begin{align}
      p(x) &= x^2 - 2 = (x+\sqrt{2})(x-\sqrt{2}), \\
      q(x) &= x^2 +1 = (x+i)(x-i).
   \end{align}
   
   $$
   Their coefficients belong to $ \Q $ but their zeros, $ \pm \sqrt{2} $
   and $ \pm i $ respectively, do not.
   This observation leads us to our first question: 
    <div class="question">
      What is the smallest algebraic structure containing the zeros of 
      some polynomial $p (x) $?
    </div>
 </p>
 <p>
    We know that $ \mathbb{C} $, the algebraic closure of $ \Q $,
    contains the zeros. However, we don't need the full algebraic closure
   to discuss a specific polynomial.
    We can work with something much smaller. If dealing with 
    $ p(x) = x^2 - 2 $, it suffices with the set of all elements of the 
    form $ a+b\sqrt{2} $, with $a,b \in \Q$. 
    This set is closed under the field operations and contains 
    all the zeros of $ p(x) $. 
    The same can be said about $ a + bi $ and $ q(x) $. 
    These sets are called <em>splitting fields</em> and they
    seem important
    enough to have their definition inside a box:
 </p>
<div class="def">
   The splitting field $ K $ of a polynomial with 
   coefficients in the base field $ F $ is the smallest field 
   where the polynomial decomposes into linear factors.
</div>
<p>
   Before we constructed the splitting fields of $ p $ and $ q $ by
   adding a new element ($ \sqrt{2}$ and  $ i $ respectively) 
   and all its multiples with coefficients in the base field. 
   This is a procedure we can formalize. 
   Given a field $ F $, we can <em>extend</em> it with a new element 
   $ \alpha $ to get a larger field. 
   We say $ F $ adjoined $ \alpha $ for this new 
   field and write $ F (\alpha) $. 
   In case this field extension contains all the zeros of some polynomial
   $ r(x) $ we say it is its splitting field.
</p>

<p>
    We now know how to extend once. There is nothing 
    keeping us from extending again. Taking $ F = \Q (\sqrt{2}) $ and 
    adjoining $ \sqrt{3} $ we get $ K = F(\sqrt{3}) 
    = \Q ( \sqrt{2} )( \sqrt{3}) = \Q (\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) $. This
    new field $ K $ contains all zeros of $ q(x) = p(x)(x^2-3) $, 
    but also all the zeros of $ r(x) = q(x)(x-a_1)...(x-a_n) $ where the
    $ a_i $ are in $ \Q $. 
 </p>

 <p> 
   One more example. Take $ r(x) = x^3 -2 $. Its zeros are
   $$
   \begin{align}
      z_1 &= \sqrt[3]{2}, \\
      z_2 &= \sqrt[3]{2}e^{\frac{2\pi}{3}i}, \\
      z_3 &= \sqrt[3]{2}e^{\frac{4\pi}{3}i}.
   \end{align}
   $$
   What is its splitting field?
   The set $ \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) $ of all elements 
   $ a + b\sqrt[3]{2} + c\sqrt[3]{4}$ is not yet splitting. We need to 
   adjoin some complex number as well, for example 
   $ e^{\frac{2\pi}{3}i} $ to obtain
   $ \Q(\sqrt[3]{2},e^{\frac{2\pi}{3}i}) $. Any element in this
   splitting field looks like 
   <div class="w3-red">continue here</div> 

</p>
 <p>
   Is it always write the splitting field of a polynomial as an 
   extension of the base field $ \Q $ ? 
 </p>
 <p>
    We can now try to formulate our goal in terms of splitting fields?
