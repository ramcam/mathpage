<h3>Quintic polynomials are rarely solvable</h3>

<p>
    $ \newcommand{\Q}{\mathbb{Q}} $
    The insolvability of the quintic is a problem that has given me a fair 
    amount of headache. Its proof by means of Galois theory is highly abstract and
    is usually exposed by concatenating several seeminly unmotivated steps.
</p>
<p>
    Here I will try to take you 
    (with some effort from your side) 
    through a path in which you feel that one step unfolds 
    naturally from the other. 
</p>
<p>
    It will probably not be the fastest path,
    but will surely be more rewarding than trying to digest a polished
    exposition. 
 </p>

 <p>
    Be sure to check the list of requirements before embarking 
    on this journey. You should have basic knowledge of
    <ul>
        <li>Rings and fields</li>
        <li>Polynomials over a field</li>
        <li>Field extensions</li>
        <li>Algebraic closures</li>
    </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
    Informally, what we set out to prove is that
 </p>
 <p class="informal-def">
    The zeros of quintic polynomials 
    cannot always be written with a radical expression.
 </p>
 <p>
    We are referring to quintic polynomials with coefficients in 
    $ \Q $ here. A radical expression means combining
    elements in $ \Q $ with the 
    usual operations of the field ($ + - \times \div$) and 
    $ \sqrt[n]{\phantom{a}} $, like this
    $$
    \frac{3\sqrt[7]{1-\sqrt[3]{-1}}}{11\sqrt[5]{8}}.
    $$
 </p>
 <p>
    
    You will recall that a field is closed under the operations
    $ + - \times \div$ (except for dividing by zero). However,
    $n$-th roots might take us <em>outside</em> of $ \Q $. 
    This first observation leads us to our first question: 
    <p class="question">What is the algebraic structure containing the zeros of 
        some polynomial $p (x) $?</p>
 </p>
 <p>
    If you are familiar with the concept of algebraic closure then you 
    have an answer. However, we don't need the full algebraic closure of
    $ \Q $, that is $ \mathbb{C} $, to discuss a specific polynomial.
    We can work with something much smaller. If dealing with 
    $ p(x) = x^2 - 2 $ we just need to <em>extend</em> $ \Q $ with $ \sqrt{2} $. 
    We say $ \Q $ adjoined $ \sqrt{2} $ for this new field consisting
    of all elements of the form $ a+b\sqrt{2} $, and write $ \Q (\sqrt{2}) $. 
    This new field contains all zeros of $ p(x) $. 
</p>
<p>
    There is nothing 
    keeping us from extending again. Taking $ F = \Q (\sqrt{2}) $ and 
    adjoining $ \sqrt{3} $ we get $ K = F(\sqrt{3}) 
    = \Q ( \sqrt{2} )( \sqrt{3}) = \Q (\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) $. This
    new field $ K $ contains all zeros of $ q(x) = p(x)(x^2-3) $, 
    but also all the zeros of $ r(x) = q(x)(x-a_1)...(x-a_n) $ where the
    $ a_i $ are in $ \Q $. Let's call this field, the smallest 
    one containing all the zeros of some $ p(x) $, the splitting field 
    of $ p(x) $. 
 </p>
 <p>
    We can now try to formulate our goal in terms of splitting fields?
