<h3>What is a group?</h3>

Informally, a <b>group</b> is an algebraic structure where 
operations can always be undone. 

Take a binary operation $✿$ and a set $G$ closed respect to $✿$.
Any two elements &g, h \in G$ can be combined to produce a third like so:
\[
    g✿h = k.
\]
You may think of this as something we did to $h$ on its right side.
Since we said every operation in our group may be undone,
it should be possible to write
\[
    g^{-1}✿k = g^{-1}✿g✿h = h
\]
to obtain the original $h$. In order for this to work properly, 
we need that $g^{-1}✿g$ equals something that leaves $h$ untoched.
We call this the identity element $e$. Then
\[
    g^{-1}✿k = g^{-1}✿g✿h = e✿h = h.
\]

Why is this interesting? A couple of reasons:
You probably heard that wherever there is symmetry, there is a group.
Also, the simplest equation you can imagine, &ax=b& requires you to use
groups and nothing more in order to solve it.

(Add axiomatic definition.)
