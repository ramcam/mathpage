<h3>What is a group?</h3>

<p>
    Suppose you find yourself working with a problem. Suppose this problem 
    involves some set of mathematical objects which can be <em>combined 
    to produce objects of the same kind.</em> 
</p>
<p>
    Maybe you are adding integer numbers, or combining rotations and 
    reflections that leave the vertices of some shape fixed, maybe you are
    just performing rotations one ofter another in space, 
    maybe you are composing continuous functions, 
    or adding vectors, or just adding minutes in a clock while you wait 
    for the bus. It doesn't matter what the objects are as long as two of
    them combined produce a third of the same kind. We will be more
    specific about what that might mean.
</p>
<p>
    If you were adding integers, you would surely write $ a + b = c $. 
    When combining two rotations $ A $ and $ B $ in space, 
    maybe $ AB = C $ is convenient since $ AB \neq BA $ in three 
    dimensions, and using $ + $ would be confusing. If composing
    functions $ a(x) $ and $ b(x) $ then $ a \circ b = c$ is standard notation.
    For vector addition or minutes in a clock $ a + b = c $ 
    should also make sense. Again, it is irrelevant which symbol you 
    choose for the binary operation at hand. It is usual to use the additive 
    notation $ a + b $ for commutative operations, and the multiplicative
    notation $ ab $ for non-commutative operations.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose now that in your quest to solve your problem, you arrive at 
    some expression $ ax= b $ (or $ a+x=c $ ), where $ x $ is unknown. 
    You wonder if it would be possible to <em>neutralize</em> that annoying 
    $ a $ so the $ x $ is isolated, and the problem solved.
</p>
<p> 
    What should we require take for that to be
    possible?
</p>
<p>
    Certainly if in the set of objects, for any given $ a $
    we can find an <em>inverse</em> object, we have come a long way.
    Let's call it $ a^{-1} $ or $ -a $ in additive notation.
</p>
<p>
    This allows us to do apply the <em>inverse</em> to both sides
    of the equation
    $$
    \begin{align}
    ax &= b\\
    a^{-1}(ax) &= a^{-1}(b) \\
    (a^{-1}a)x&= a^{-1}b.
    \end{align}
    $$
    Note that we have introduced a new requirement in the last step: 
    our operations must be associative. We are very close to
    solving for $ x $. We now need that $ a^{-1} a $ somehow vanishes.
    We must require that the result of $ a^{-1} a $ is a special object,
    let's name it $ e $, with the property that $ e $ combined with 
    any other element $ g $ results again in $ g $. This must be true
    whem applying $ e $ to the left or right of $ g $. Then $ eg=ge = g $.
    We call $ e $ the <em>identity element</em>.
</p>
<p>
We can pick up where we left it and finally solve for $ x $:
$$
\begin{align}
(a^{-1}a)x&= a^{-1}b \\
ex&= a^{-1}b \\
x&= a^{-1}b.
\end{align}
$$

So far we have required:
<ul>
    <li>Existence of inverse elements</li>
    <li>Associativity</li>
    <li>Identity element.</li>
</ul>
    We are now ready for the formal definition of a group:
</p>
<div class="def">
    A <b>group</b> is a set $ G $ closed under the associative binary operation $ * $
    such that:
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is an $ e \in G $ such that $ g*e = e*g = g $ 
            for every $ g \in G $.
        </li>
        <li>
            For every $ g \in G $ there is a $ g^{-1} $ such that 
            $ g*g^{-1} = g^{-1}*g = e $.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    What have we achieved?

    We have found <em>one</em> solution.

    But.. are there more?
</p>

<p>
    Suppose there is a solution <b style="color: red;">
        [continue here...]</b>
</p>

<p>
    You probably heard that wherever there is symmetry, there is a group.
    Also, the simplest equation you can imagine, $ ax = b $ requires you to use
    groups and nothing more in order to find a <i>unique</i> solution. But what are groups 
    and how do they relate to the previous questions?
</p>

<p>
    First, an informal definition:
</p>

<div class="informal-def">
    A <b>group</b> is an algebraic structure where 
    operations can always be undone. 
</div>

<p>
Take an associative binary operation $ * $ and a set $ G $ closed respect to $ * $.
Any two elements $ g, h \in G $ can be combined to produce a third element $ k $:
$$
    g*h = k.
$$
You may think of this as something we did to $ h $ on its right side.
</p>
<p>
Since we said every operation in our group may be undone,
it should be possible to recover $ h $ by applying $ g^{-1} $ to 
both sides to the equation:
$$
g^{-1}*(k) = g^{-1}*(g*h) = (g^{-1}*g)*h = h,
$$
undoing what we did to $ h $ in the first place. 
In order for the last equality to work properly, 
we need that $ (g^{-1}*g) $ equals something that leaves $ h $ untouched.
We call this the identity element $ e $. Then
$$
    (g^{-1}*g)*h = e*h = h.
$$

Now we have what we wanted. An algebraic structure where everything we 
do by means of $ * $ can be undone. Note what we have used so far to 
guarantee the properties we were after. It's really very few conditions we 
have imposed. We have required an associative binary operation, 
the existence of inverses, and some sort of identity element. </p>

<p>We are now ready for the formal definition:</p>

    <div class="def">
        A <b>group</b> is a set $ G $ closed under the associative binary operation $ * $
        such that:
        <ul>
            <li>
                There is an $ e \in G $ such that $ g*e = e*g = g $ 
                for every $ g \in G $.
            </li>
            <li>
                For every $ g \in G $ there is a $ g^{-1} $ such that 
                $ g*g^{-1} = g^{-1}*g = e $.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
