<h3>What is a group?</h3>
<p>
    You probably heard that wherever symmetry appears, groups appear too. 
    Maybe you heard that they have to do with solving equations. 
    Both are true. But also, much more. Groups are rather simple, yet
    a very rich theory emerges from them connecting many distant areas in math.
    What are groups, why are they interesting and in which context 
    do they arise naturally?
</p>
<p>
    First, an informal definition:
</p>
<div class="informal-def">
    A <b>group</b> is the simplest algebraic structure where 
    some operation can always be undone. 
</div>
<p>
    What do we mean by this?
</p>
<p>
    Suppose you are working on a problem involving some set of 
    mathematical objects which can be <em>combined</em>
    to produce objects of the <em>same</em> kind.

    We will look at specific examples in the next section. For 
    the moment, let's say that $ a, b $ are elements you found
    inside some set $ X $, and you have 
    a way of combining them to produce some element $ c $ also in $ X $.
    Let's call this a <em>binary operation</em>
    without going into much detail, and write </b> "$ + $" for this operation, so $ a + b = c$. 
    We could also write "$ * $" so $ a * b = c $, or just $ ab = c $. It is up to you
    which symbol to use, although it is usual to use the additive 
    notation $ a + b $ for commutative operations and the multiplicative
    notation $ ab $ for non-commutative operations. We will use multiplicative notation for the 
    rest of this section.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose now that in your quest to solve your problem, you arrive at 
    some expression $ ax= b $ (or $ a+x=b $ in additive notation), 
    where $ x $ is unknown. 
</p>
<p>
    Take a minute to observe the equation
    $$
    ax = b.
    $$
    It's a really minimal expression involving very few elements. It should
    be really easy to solve, right? We have $ a$ and $ b $, two known objects, 
    and one third unknown object $ x $ stuck to the right of the $ a $ by one implicit operation.

</p>
<p>
    You maybe wonder if it would be possible to <em>neutralize</em> that annoying 
    $ a $ so the $ x $ is isolated, and the problem solved.
</p>
<p> 
    What should we require for that to be
    possible?
</p>
<p>
    Certainly if in the set of objects where we found $ a $ 
    we require that for any given object we can find an <em>inverse</em>, 
    then we have come a long way.
    Let's call it $ a^{-1} $ or $ -a $ in additive notation.
</p>
<p>
    We can apply the <em>inverse</em> to both sides
    of $ ax = b$ and move a few steps towards our goal:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    ax &= b\\ 
    a^{-1}(ax) &= a^{-1}(b) \\
    (a^{-1}a)x&= a^{-1}b.
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    For the last step we have implicitly introduced a new 
    requirement: 
    our operations must be associative so we can place the parentheses
    around the "$ a $"s. 
</p>
<p>
    We are now very close to solving for $ x $. 
    We just declared that we must always be able to find inverses, 
    but we said nothing about what an inverse is, or what happens when
    operating something with its inverse. We need that $ a^{-1} a $ 
    somehow vanishes.
    Here comes the last requirement: $ a^{-1} a $ should result in an 
    object, let's name it $ e $, with special properties. This is
    the special element $ e $ that combined with 
    any other element $ g $ results again in $ g $. This must be true
    whem applying $ e $ to the left or right of $ g $. Then $ eg=ge = g $.
    This is the element that does nothing. You can think of it as 
    vanishing. We call $ e $ the <em>identity element</em>.
</p>
<p>
We can finally solve for $ x $, using that $ a^{-1}a=e $:
$$
\begin{align}
(a^{-1}a)x&= a^{-1}b \\
ex&= a^{-1}b \\
x&= a^{-1}b.
\end{align}
$$

We have found <em>one</em> solution for $ x $!

To guarantee this required the existence of inverse elements,
an associative operation and an identity element.
</p>
<p>
    These requirements are what define a <b>group structure.</b> 
    We are now ready for the formal definition of a group:
</p>
<div class="def">
    A <b>group</b> is a set $ G $ closed under an associative binary operation $ * $
    such that:
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is an $ e \in G $ such that $ g*e = e*g = g $ 
            for every $ g \in G $.
        </li>
        <li>
            For every $ g \in G $ there is a $ g^{-1} $ such that 
            $ g^{-1}*g = g*g^{-1} = e $.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    We found <em>one</em> solution by imposing a <b>group</b> 
    structure. But.. are there more?
</p>

<p>
    Let's give this a thought. Suppose there is more than one solution.
    That is, there is $ y \neq x $ such that $ ay = b $. Then, solving 
    for $ y $ like we did before for $ x$ we have $ y = a^{-1}b $. But
    $ x = a^{-1}b $ too, so $ a^{-1}b \neq  a^{-1}b $ which is a 
    contradiction. It turns out a group structure guarantees the existence
    of a <em>unique</em> solution. As we mentioned in our
    informal definition, this is the smallest structure achieving this.
    Not bad for such a short list of requirements!  
</p>
<p>
    Take a moment again to think about what we just achieved. What kind
    of objects and operations can be regarded as groups? Some examples are 
    addition of integers, 
    addition of vectors, 
    composition of invertible functions,
    multiplication of invertible matrices, 
    chaining rotations in space, 
    chaining symmetries of polyhedra, 
    chaining permutations
    and much more.
    We will explore some of these examples in the next section.
