<h3>What is a group?</h3>

<p>
    You probably heard that wherever there is symmetry, there is a group.
    Also, the simplest equation you can imagine, $ ax = b $ requires you to use
    groups and nothing more in order to find a <i>unique</i> solution. But what are groups 
    and how do they relate to the previous questions?
</p>

<p>
    First, an informal definition:
</p>

<div class="informal-def">
    A <b>group</b> is an algebraic structure where 
    operations can always be undone. 
</div>

<p>
Take an associative binary operation $ * $ and a set $ G $ closed respect to $ * $.
Any two elements $ g, h \in G $ can be combined to produce a third element $ k $:
$$
    g*h = k.
$$
You may think of this as something we did to $ h $ on its right side.
</p>
<p>
Since we said every operation in our group may be undone,
it should be possible to recover $ h $ by applying $ g^{-1} $ to 
both sides to the equation:
$$
g^{-1}*(k) = g^{-1}*(g*h) = (g^{-1}*g)*h = h,
$$
undoing what we did to $ h $ in the first place. 
In order for the last equality to work properly, 
we need that $ (g^{-1}*g) $ equals something that leaves $ h $ untouched.
We call this the identity element $ e $. Then
$$
    (g^{-1}*g)*h = e*h = h.
$$

Now we have what we wanted. An algebraic structure where everything we 
do by means of $ * $ can be undone. Note what we have used so far to 
guarantee the properties we were after. It's really very few conditions we 
have imposed. We have required an associative binary operation, 
the existence of inverses, and some sort of identity element. </p>

<p>We are now ready for the formal definition:</p>

<div class="def">
    A <b>group</b> is a set $ G $ closed under the associative binary operation $ * $
    such that:
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is an $ e \in G $ such that $ g*e = e*g = g $ 
            for every $ g \in G $.
        </li>
        <li>
            For every $ g \in G $ there is a $ g^{-1} $ such that 
            $ g*g^{-1} = g^{-1}*g = e $.
        </li>
    </ul>

</p>
