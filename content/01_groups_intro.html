<h3>What is a group?</h3>

<div class="informal-def">
    Informally, a <b>group</b> is an algebraic structure where 
    operations can always be undone. 
</div>

<p>
Take a binary operation $ * $ and a set $ G $ closed respect to $ * $.
Any two elements $ g, h \in G $ can be combined to produce a third like so:
$$
    g*h = k.
$$
You may think of this as something we did to $ h $ on its right side.
</p>
<p>
Since we said every operation in our group may be undone,
it should be possible to write
$$
    g^{-1}*k = g^{-1}*g*h = h
$$
to obtain the original $h$. In order for this to work properly, 
we need that $ g^{-1}*g $ equals something that leaves $ h $ untoched.
We call this the identity element $ e $. Then
$$
    g^{-1}*k = g^{-1}*g*h = e*h = h.
$$

Why is this interesting? A couple of reasons:
You probably heard that wherever there is symmetry, there is a group.
Also, the simplest equation you can imagine, $ ax = b $ requires you to use
groups and nothing more in order to solve it.

<p>Here is the formal definition of a group:</p>

<div class="def">
    A <b>group</b> is a set $ G $ closed under the binary operation $ * $
    such that:
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is an $ e \in G $ such that $ g*e = e*g = g $ 
            for every $ g \in G $.
        </li>
        <li>
            For every $ g \in G $ there is a $ g^{-1} $ such that 
            $ g*g^{-1} = g^{-1}*g = e $.
        </li>
        <li>
            The binary operation is associative, that is, 
            for $ g, h, j \in G $, $ (g*h)*j = g*(h*j) $.
        </li>
    </ul>

</p>
