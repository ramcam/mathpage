<h3>What is a group?</h3>

<p>
    Suppose you find yourself working with a problem. Suppose this problem 
    involves some set of mathematical objects which can be <em>combined 
    to produce objects of the same kind.</em> 
</p>
<p>
    Maybe you are adding integer numbers, or combining rotations and 
    reflections that leave the vertices of some shape fixed, maybe you are
    just performing rotations one ofter another in space, 
    maybe you are composing continuous functions, 
    or adding vectors, or just adding minutes in a clock while you wait 
    for the bus. It doesn't matter what the objects are as long as two of
    them combined produce a third of the same kind. We will be more
    specific about what that might mean.
</p>
<p>
    If you were adding integers $ a $ and $ b $, you would surely write $ a + b = c $. 
    When combining two rotations $ A $ and $ B $ in space, 
    maybe $ AB = C $ is convenient since $ AB \neq BA $ in three 
    dimensions, and using $ + $ would be confusing. If composing
    functions $ a(x) $ and $ b(x) $ then $ a \circ b = c$ is standard notation.
    For vector addition or minutes in a clock $ a + b = c $ 
    should also make sense. Again, it is irrelevant which symbol you 
    choose for the binary operation at hand. It is however usual to use the additive 
    notation $ a + b $ for commutative operations and the multiplicative
    notation $ ab $ for non-commutative operations.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose now that in your quest to solve your problem, you arrive at 
    some expression $ ax= b $ (or $ a+x=c $ ), where $ x $ is unknown. 
    You wonder if it would be possible to <em>neutralize</em> that annoying 
    $ a $ so the $ x $ is isolated, and the problem solved.
</p>
<p> 
    What should we require for that to be
    possible?
</p>
<p>
    Certainly if in the set of objects, for any given $ a $
    we can find an <em>inverse</em> object, we have come a long way.
    Let's call it $ a^{-1} $ or $ -a $ in additive notation.
</p>
<p>
    This allows us to do apply the <em>inverse</em> to both sides
    of the equation
    $$
    \begin{align}
    ax &= b\\
    a^{-1}(ax) &= a^{-1}(b) \\
    (a^{-1}a)x&= a^{-1}b.
    \end{align}
    $$
    Note that we have introduced a new requirement in the last step: 
    our operations must be associative so we can place the parentheses
    around the "$ a $"s. 
    We are very close to
    solving for $ x $. We now need that $ a^{-1} a $ somehow vanishes.
    We must require that the result of $ a^{-1} a $ is a special object,
    let's name it $ e $, with the property that $ e $ combined with 
    any other element $ g $ results again in $ g $. This must be true
    whem applying $ e $ to the left or right of $ g $. Then $ eg=ge = g $.
    We call $ e $ the <em>identity element</em>.
</p>
<p>
We can pick up where we left it and finally solve for $ x $:
$$
\begin{align}
(a^{-1}a)x&= a^{-1}b \\
ex&= a^{-1}b \\
x&= a^{-1}b.
\end{align}
$$

We have found <em>one</em> solution for $ x $!

To guarantee this we had to require:
<ul>
    <li>Existence of inverse elements</li>
    <li>Associativity</li>
    <li>Identity element.</li>
</ul>
    These requirements are what define a <b>group</b> structure. 
    We are now ready for the formal definition of a group:
</p>
<div class="def">
    A <b>group</b> is a set $ G $ closed under an associative binary operation $ * $
    such that:
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is an $ e \in G $ such that $ g*e = e*g = g $ 
            for every $ g \in G $.
        </li>
        <li>
            For every $ g \in G $ there is a $ g^{-1} $ such that 
            $ g^{-1}*g = g*g^{-1} = e $.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    We have found <em>one</em> solution by imposing a <b>group</b> 
    structure. But.. are there more?
</p>

<p>
    Let's give this a thought. Suppose there is more than one solution.
    That is, there is $ y \neq x $ such that $ ay = b $. Then, solving 
    for $ y $ like we did before for $ x$ we have $ y = a^{-1}b $. But
    $ x = a^{-1}b $ too, so $ a^{-1}b \neq  a^{-1}b $ which is a 
    contradiction. It turns out a group structure guarantees the existence
    of a <em>unique</em> solution. Not bad for such a short list of 
    requirements!  
</p>
<p>
    What kind of problems do not accept a group structure?
    Many kinds, for example problems involving <em>irreversible</em>
    operations. Projecting a 3d sphere into a disk is irreversible because
    if you were handed the squished disk in the first place, how could you
    tell if its original state was a sphere or a cylinder? Similarly,
    multiplying an integer by zero is irreversible. What could you possibly
    do to zero to get the original integer?
    A more informal, but maybe more insightful definition of <em>what</em>
    a group is could be the following:
</p>
<div class="informal-def">
    A <b>group</b> is an algebraic structure where 
    operations can always be undone. 
</div>
<p>But we are barely scratching the surface of Group Theory. In the next 
section we will explore all kinds of groups and some of their basic
properties. We will also explore the connection between groups and symmetry.
</p>
<p>
    <b style="color: red;">
        [continue here...]</b>
</p>


Now we have what we wanted. An algebraic structure where everything we 
do by means of $ * $ can be undone. Note what we have used so far to 
guarantee the properties we were after. It's really very few conditions we 
have imposed. We have required an associative binary operation, 
the existence of inverses, and some sort of identity element. </p>
