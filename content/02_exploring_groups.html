<h3>Exploring groups</h3>

Examples must contain:
- Finite group, prime order
- Finite group, composite order
- Finite group, commutative
- Finite group, non-commutative (smallest possible example)
- Finite group, cyclic
- Finite group, non-cyclic
- Finite, simple
- Finite, non-simple
- Finitely generated, Z3xZ6 (one multiple of other, non-cyclic).
- Finitely generated, Z3xZ5 (prime, so cyclic)
- Symmetric groups
- Several finite groups, same order
- Infinite group, cyclic
- Infinite group, generator set size 2 (free group 2 letters)
- Infinite group, non-cyclic
- Infinite group, commutative
- Infinite group, non-commutative

Examples of non-groups:
- multiplication of integers, rationals
- composition of cont. funs

Properties:
- Order of group
-- Finite, Infinite
- Cyclic
- Subgroups

Creating groups from smaller groups:
- Finitely generated
- Nesting groups

- Normal subgroups
- Simple groups
