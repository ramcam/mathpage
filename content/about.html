            Welcome to tiny math, a site dedicated to explaining math in an 
            accessible way, one tiny step at a time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Tiny math grew out (and still does!) from 
            a series of oral math lessons given while jogging through Oslo.
            My jogging companion and recipient of the lessons is Salas, my 
            partner. With no pencil and paper or any other visual means at hand, 
            the oral nature of the lessons
            forced me to build up concepts slowly, relying mostly on mental images
            and boiling down topics to the most essential intuitions. Salas
            natural talent to ask just the right question contributed to 
            gradually shape the lessons. This website is dedicated to her.
            I hope you enjoy it.
