    <h3>What is a group?</h3>
    
    This is a typical post from a separate html file. 
    A group \( G \) is a set with a binary operation \( * )\ such that:
    <ul>There is an identity element \(e\) such that \(e*g = g*e = g \)
        for every element in the group.
    </ul>
    <ul>For every \( g \) there exists a \( g^(-1) )\ such that \(g*g^(-1) = e\)</ul>
    <ul>The operation \( * \) is associative.</ul>
    
    That is the definition of a group.
